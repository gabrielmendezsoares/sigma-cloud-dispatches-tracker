# 🚓 Sigma Cloud Dispatches Tracker

## 📋 Overview

Sigma Cloud Dispatches Tracker is an automated monitoring and alerting system designed to track dispatch activity across integrated external platforms, such as Segware. The system periodically retrieves recent dispatch data for all registered companies and accounts, evaluates the volume of activity against predefined thresholds, and sends alerts when excessive dispatches are detected.

This core execution logic is responsible for fetching operational data, analyzing patterns based on business rules, and triggering structured alarm events when necessary. To prevent redundant alerts, the system persists trigger states per account and updates them only when thresholds are exceeded. All alerts and their statuses (sent or failed) are logged in a central database to ensure reliability, traceability, and recovery in case of failure.

The system is designed to be run on a schedule, ensuring continuous surveillance of dispatch activity across environments.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Automate the monitoring of dispatch volumes across companies and accounts
- Compare dispatch activity against a fixed threshold within a defined time window (default: 4 dispatches over 3 days)
- Generate and send alarm events to external systems (Segware) when thresholds are exceeded
- Persist event and trigger data to prevent redundant or duplicate alerts
- Maintain historical log of all alert attempts, including both successful and failed transmissions
- Enable reliable, repeatable executions using scheduled jobs or background workers
- Handle API and system-level errors gracefully and log them for observability
- Ensure seamless integration with Segware’s API through authenticated requests and structured data handling
